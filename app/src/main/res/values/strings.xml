    <string name="about_us">Kotlin is an open-source, general-purpose, statically typed programming language. It is JVM-based and may be used in all projects where Java is currently used. It may be used to create Android apps, server-side apps, and a variety of other applications. It is an improved version of Java and is completely interoperable with it. We can even mix Kotlin and Java in the same project. It blends Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) and functional programming in a platform that is unlimited, self-contained, and unique. It also enables functional twinning using microcodes. The JetBrains team created Kotlin. The language was initially launched in February 2016 after a project began in 2010 to develop it. The Apache 2.0 license was used to create Kotlin. Programs written in Kotlin do not require semicolons. This makes the code more readable and easy to understand. This language enables the interchange and usage of Java in a variety of ways. Furthermore, code written in Java and Kotlin can coexist in the same project. The type system of Kotlin is designed to eliminate NullPointerException from code. Writing new code in Kotlin will take you less time. Kotlin code is even easier to deploy and manage at scale.</string>

We have a multi layered check of the Franchisee in order to hire a reliable one for the Franchisor, we associate. Our initial screening starts with a local FO, on whose reference, we register a local franchisee, who meets all our Franchisor’s requirements and then our local FDM will complete the Franchisee’s KYC, thoroughly. Then a state level FM shall verify the financial and other requisites of Franchisee and then shall be processed to BIZ BULLS HO for acceptance.

We prefer to mention each and every small &amp; negligible detail in the agreement to provide a clear view of distribution of duties and responsibilities of both the parties.

Hence our utmost priority and concern is to keep up the Franchisor brand positioning in the Franchisee outlets and maintaining the uniformity of business throughout the Franchisee outlets spread across. As the outlet location controls the business revenue, in our initial registration process itself we cooperate with the Franchisee, in finding a better location for outlet and share the same with the Franchisor through google positioning. Similarly our setup vendor is also very well experienced in providing the setup, as per the Franchisor’s business standards, under our BIZ BULLS team coordination.</string>
